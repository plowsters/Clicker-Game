Stock Market Game
-Start with 100 dollars and 5 stocks to invest in
-React to market fluctuations
-"Insider Trading" will generally make a given stock go up (not guaranteed, this is a market after all)
-Every second the market fluctuates and your stocks can go up or down in value by a random amount. They also have a random chance to go up or down 10 dollars at a time and an even smaller chance to go up or down 100 dollars in a single second
-Wealth that is not stored in stocks is stored in your bank vault
-Prestige mechanic at 1 million dollars in the vault that adds more available stocks and stock price manipulators

-WIP
  -Display Vault Balance
  -Display # of stocks owned and price @ purchase
  -Decide what Insider Trading does
  -Stock Trend Graphs
  -Prestige Mechanic

-Ideas to implement:
  
  -Day/Week Tracker
  -Source of Income
  -Recurrent Bills (goal of the game is to keep up with increasingly expensive bills)
