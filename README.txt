Stock Market Game
-Start with 100 dollars and 5 stocks to invest in
-React to market fluctuations

-Every second the market fluctuates and your stocks can go up or down in value by a random amount. They also have a random chance to go up or down 10 dollars at a time and an even smaller chance to go up or down 100 dollars in a single second
-Wealth that is not stored in stocks is stored in your bank vault
-Prestige mechanic at 1 million dollars in the vault that adds more available stocks and stock price manipulators
